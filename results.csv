We began with a mission to change and positively transform the lives of everyone around us. Over the 50+ years since our inception, as a conglomerate, each of our businesses has launched various thoughtful programs that are of direct benefit to marginalized populations and issues of the environment. Purti Realty enjoys a great relationship with various schools and NGOs to which we directly send in our support. Our programs are centered around education and green initiatives. Green school campaign Grow with Green is the Purti Foundation’s motto and belief! We were at the Harvard Public School, Tangra on 25th Jan, 2018 to help the school students plant trees in the school compound. As a real estate and infrastructure organization, environmental issues are of utmost importance to us. We duly comply with all the legally bound environmental laws and even go beyond the bare minimum. We have carried out various Grow with Green campaigns across schools. Our plant a tree activity is directly aimed at enabling the children to grow a relationship with their surroundings and the flora around them Be kind to donate in kind Purti Realty has also exclusively partnered with the Kids of Hope Foundation Shelter Homes and Eurokids, Kolkata to create multiple activities for the children. One such activity that was carried out centered around humanity wherein we had a group of fabulous educators speaking about the need for kindness. COVID 19 - Food & Necessities Drive The year 2020 was a particularly hard one for the globe. With a virus that took over and halted the lives of many, the Purti group strived to be a rock for its entire stakeholder system and the community around us. For the entirety of the lockdown period in 2020 and 2021, in association with individuals and local NGOs, we carried out continuous drives to distribute food and other necessities. Local Area Sanitization Drive During the phase of Covid, regular sanitization drives have become a necessity to keep coronavirus at bay.
